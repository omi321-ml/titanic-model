# 🚢 Titanic Survival Prediction Model

## 📖 Overview
This project uses **Machine Learning** to predict whether a passenger survived the Titanic shipwreck or not.  
The dataset used is the famous **Titanic dataset** from Kaggle.

The Jupyter Notebook (`tytanic_model.ipynb`) contains data analysis, visualization, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.

---

## 🎯 Objective
The goal of this project is to:
- Analyze Titanic passenger data.
- Build a predictive model using Machine Learning algorithms.
- Understand which features most affected survival rates.

---

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies
- **Python**
- **Jupyter Notebook**
- **Pandas**
- **NumPy**
- **Matplotlib / Seaborn**
- **Scikit-learn**

---

## ⚙️ Installation & Setup

Follow these steps to run the notebook on your computer:

### 1️⃣ Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/titanic-survival-model.git

2️⃣ Navigate into the Project Folder
cd titanic-survival-model

3️⃣ Install Required Packages
pip install -r requirements.txt

4️⃣ Run the Jupyter Notebook
jupyter notebook tytanic_model.ipynb

📊 Dataset

The dataset contains information about Titanic passengers such as:

Name

Age

Gender

Ticket Class

Fare

Cabin

Embarked Port

Survival Status (0 = Died, 1 = Survived)

You can download the dataset from:
🔗 Kaggle - Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster

🤖 Model

The notebook includes:

Data Cleaning & Preprocessing

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Feature Selection

Model Training (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, etc.)

Model Evaluation (Accuracy, Confusion Matrix)

🧾 Example Output

After training, the model predicts survival probabilities based on passenger attributes.
